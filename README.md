Since Flexradio does not output any band data from the device, the Flexwire bus unfortunately does not work. (is not implemented by Flex)
I have created a circuit board which adapts the USB signal to TTL to the Arduino Every.
The Flexradio only recognizes FTDI converters!
The board has BCD out, TXin and TXout, as well as 16 I/O via PCF8575 for other functions.
I need the board to control my VL-1000.

The software is currently under development and so far only reads and selects the data.
